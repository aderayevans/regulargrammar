Hi!
Welcome to our program

This is a command line interface program. First you need to extract it, then run RegularGrammar.py and type keyword
Please extract all files before run it to not get error.

What can we do:
    Convert Right|Left_linear Regular Grammar to NFAepsilon
    Convert NFA|DFA|NFAepsilon to Right|Left_linear Regular Grammar
    Identify whether a string is accepted by NFA|DFA|NFAepsilon or not
    Identify whether a string is baccepted by Right|Left_linear Regular Grammar or not	
	
	Thanks for using our program, hope this helps you!
